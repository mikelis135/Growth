## Challenging

- Figuring out the best approach for the UI to make it flexible and scalable took some brainstorming
  but i figured a modularized layout approach would fit it perfectly and that is what i used, also
  writing unit tests for some thread based components due to few resources but i used the examples
  from my research from the Google's android team i also wrote other unit tests (converters for
  database) and UI tests
